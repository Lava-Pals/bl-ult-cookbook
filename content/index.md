title: Welcome to the Ult Cookbook!

Welcome to the Ult Cookbook! This site acts as a mirror for our public repository hosted on GitHub.

This cookbook is intended to help upskill BONELAB modders in the world of UltEvent weirdness, with examples along the way.

## Pre-Requisites

- These docs *will* operate under the assumption that you have a Unity project setup with the latest [Marrow ExtendedSDK](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/Marrow-ExtendedSDK-MAINTAINED) scripts - which extend the base SDK created by SLZ, and provides you with scripts they internally that aren't otherwise available for mod makers.
- Some basic programming knowledge is recommended - or knowledge of data-types and other terminology (strings, bools, floats, methods, etc...)

## Ready to Start?

Each page will teach you bits along the way, and this will build up as you progress. For that reason we suggest starting at [[cookbook/1. Crawling and  Hooking/1.1 Parent Under Anything|1.1 Parent Under Anything]], and referring to previous material as you go on if needed.

Please remember that you're not alone in this - UltEvents can quickly get *very* complex. Be patient with yourself - you can ask around in the [BONELAB Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/mjmpUR8)'s modding channels if you need help.

We also have a thread over in that server - if you have any feedback, do let us know!
