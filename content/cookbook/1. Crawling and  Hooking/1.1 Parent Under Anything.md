[Transform.Find](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.Find.html) can be used to locate other Transforms in the hierarchy.

## Searching Underneath a Transform

We can use `Transform.Find` on one Transform to search underneath it. Here we use it to search underneath `Foo`, find `Bar`, and re-parent `Subject` to be underneath it:

Taking this a step further, we can use slashes (`/`) to add more transforms to our search.  By typing `Bar/Baz`, we can crawl down the hierarchy from `Foo` -> `Bar` -> `Baz`:

## Searching Underneath the Root of the Hierarchy

A lot of the time, we'll actually want to search down the *root* of the hierarchy, instead of relative to another Transform (So underneath our scene - `Marrow Template Scene` instead of `Foo` in this case).

To do this, insert a `/` to the start of the path. This works with any Transform we run the `Find` method on!

*No matter what Transform we feed into the call, putting a `/` at the start will **always** make it search underneath the root of the scene.*

## Searching the Parent of a Transform

Need to crawl up the hierarchy instead of down? Adding `../` to the path will tell Unity to go backwards.

In this example - parenting under BONELAB's Flashlight spawnable and invoking this Event can be used to turn it on:
