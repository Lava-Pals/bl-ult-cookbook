Operating on numbers in UltEvents is tricky. We generally use either the X/Y/Z position of a Transform to store numbers that need to change.

Counters can be *super* useful for logic - you could create thrusters with customisable speed, cycle between skins on a spawnable, or feed the value directly into a shader to customisable the look of something.

## Increasing the Counter

[`Transform.Translate`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html) adds the Vector we provided it to our Transform's position:

*Transform.Translate is used to add 1 to our Transform's X position each time.*

## Getting a Float from our Counter

To get the value of our counter, we can check the distance between `0, 0, 0` and its current local position.

> [!INFO] Why use *local* position instead of position?
> Unlike [`Transform.position`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html), [`Transform.localPosition`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform-localPosition.html) isn't influenced by anything above it in the hierarchy. This is important as say, we wouldn't want the position of our vehicle to effect our counter that's parented underneath it.

*The counter's value (as stored in the Transform's position) is converted to a float and outputted to the Delayed Ult Event Holder's Delay for visual purposes.*

## Getting an Integer from a Counter

`MathF.RoundToInt` rounds floats to whole numbers and outputs the integer.

> [!TIP] Always round when working with whole numbers!
> When working with whole numbers, try to *always round the number first.* This avoids problems with [floating-point imprecision](https://timothybramlett.com/floating-point-imprecision/).

## Clamping

We don't always want our counter to be able to increase and decrease infinitely.

### Clamping the Maximum Value

[`Vector3.Min`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Min.html) takes two Vector3s, and choses the *smallest* XYZ components from each.

Whenever our counter goes up, we can use `Vector3.Min` to overwrite it if it goes above a certain value: 

![[Attachments/4.1 Creating a Counter.md_Attachments/Clamp Max 1.gif]]

*The logic on the ClampMaxValue GameObject is ran whenever the counter goes up. A minimum value between `X: 4, Y: 0, Z: 0` prevents our counter from going above `X: 4, Y: 0, Z: 0`*

### Clamping the Minimum Value

Similarly, [`Vector3.Max`](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Max.html) takes two Vector3s, and choses the *largest* XYZ components from each.

We can use this to stop our counter from going below a certain value, or combine it with the previous logic to clamp up and down:

![[Attachments/4.1 Creating a Counter.md_Attachments/Clamp Min 1.gif]]

*The new logic on the ClampMinValue GameObject selects the max XYZ components between the counter's local position and `X: 0, Y: 0, Z: 0`. This stops it from going below 0. Combined with the previous logic on 'ClampMaxValue', our counter is now limited between values 0 and 4!*
