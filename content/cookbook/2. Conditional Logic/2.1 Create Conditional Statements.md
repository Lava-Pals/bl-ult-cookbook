Sometimes, you only want to run logic if a certain thing is true.

UltEvents *really* start to fall apart here, and we'll need to be smart to work around its limitations.

## Checking if two values are Equal

[`object.Equals`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.equals?view=net-9.0) is used to check if two values are equal. Update events run every frame. I used one here in play mode to demonstrate this:

## Checking if two Values are Unequal

Similarly, to check if two values are *not* equal, you can use another equals method to invert your logic.
